# Imovies

I've created this simple web app to learn Python Django web framework.

What did I learn:

- Python: Primitive Types, Control flow, Functions, Data structures, Exception, and Classes.
- Python Package Index: Pypi, pip, Virtual environment, and pipenv.
- Django: MVT, Migrations, Admin, Customization the admin, creating REST API's, and a lot of things ...
